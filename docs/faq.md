**A:** The application automatically detects your browser language and location to provide results in your local language. You can change the language preference in your browser settings.

## Markers and Locations

Using WiFi when available can help reduce mobile data usage.

## API and Integration

### Q: Can I use the Google Maps Clone API in my own application?

**A:** The application is primarily designed for end-user use. For API access to integrate mapping functionality into your own applications, please refer to the Google Maps Platform documentation.

### Q: What Google Maps APIs are used?

## Performance and Optimization

### Q: Why does the application sometimes load slowly?

**A:** Slow loading can be caused by:
- Slow internet connection
- High server load
- Large amounts of map data to load
- Browser performance issues
- Outdated browser version

### Q: How can I reduce data usage?

**A:** To reduce data usage:
- Use WiFi when available
- Limit the number of markers displayed
- Avoid frequent searches
- Clear cache regularly
- Use lighter map styles when available

### Q: Why does the map sometimes lag when I zoom or pan?

**A:** Map lag can occur due to:
- Loading new map tiles
- Rendering many markers
- Complex calculations
- Browser performance limitations
- Network latency

Try reducing the number of visible markers or using a simpler map style.

### Q: How can I improve battery life on mobile devices?

**A:** To conserve battery:
- Reduce screen brightness
- Close other applications
- Use WiFi instead of cellular data
- Limit interactive map usage
- Enable battery saver mode
